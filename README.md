** Custom images made from the project requirements, the main theme of the webpage was pastries but in this case mada much more sense adding pictures of the project development

### Utilities 

As said before the main axis of this project was to use utilities like colors , spacing and padding formatters, in order to make the webpage responsive .

We made good use of :

1. Margin utilities (MArgin , paddings on elements and responsiveness)
2. Color changes (Variables , classes , color Palette and some custom navbar design)
3. Text utilities (like centering with bootstrap classes or modify their by default style )
